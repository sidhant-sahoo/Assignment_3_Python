# Assignment- 3 (Python)
This repository contains two Python scripts:

## Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function
**Functionality:**  
- The function factorial(a) is defined to compute the factorial.
- If a is less than 2, it returns 1 (base case for recursion).
- Otherwise, it recursively multiplies a by the factorial of a-1.
- The user inputs a number, and the script prints its factorial.

## Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
**Functionality:**  
- Computes the square root of a number using sqrt().
- Calculates the natural logarithm using log().
- Finds the sine value using sin().
